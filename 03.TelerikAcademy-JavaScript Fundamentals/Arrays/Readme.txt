1.Allocate array

Description

Write a program that allocates array of N integers, initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5 and the prints the obtained array on the console.

Input

On the only line you will receive the number N
Output

Print the obtained array on the console.
Each number should be on a new line
Constraints

1 <= N <= 20
N will always be a valid integer number
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 16MB
Sample tests

Sample test 1

Input

['5']
Output

0
5
10
15
20

2.Lexicographically compare

Write a program that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

Input

On the first line you will receive the first char array as a string
On the second line you will receive the second char array as a string
Output

Print < if the first array is lexicographically smaller
Print > if the second array is lexicographically smaller
Print = if the arrays are equal
Constraints

1 <= size of arrays <= 128
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 16MB
Sample tests

Sample test 1

Input

['hello', 'halo']
Output

Sample test 2

Input

['food', 'food']
Output

3.Maximal sequence

Description

Write a program that finds the length of the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array of N integers.

Input

On the first line you will receive the number N
On the next N lines the numbers of the array will be given
Output

Print the length of the maximal sequence
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1024
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 16MB
Sample tests

Sample test 1

Input

['10', '2', '1', '1', '2', '3', '3', '2', '2', '2', '1']
Output

3

4.Maximal increasing sequence

Description

Write a program that finds the length of the maximal increasing sequence in an array of N integers.

Input

On the first line you will receive the number N
On the next N lines the numbers of the array will be given
Output

Print the length of the maximal increasing sequence
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1024
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 16MB
